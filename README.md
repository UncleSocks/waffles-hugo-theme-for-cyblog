# Waffles: A Hugo Theme for CyBlog
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14a4276-cfe4-4527-9f3e-f5d4ba4fe989)

Waffles is a minimal dark Hugo theme inspired by the Risotto theme, created for my CyBlog website. The colorway is modeled after the cliché "hacking" computer terminal—a black/grey background with green text.

_Please note that this is the initial release and is still under development._

## Features

The current version of the theme only has basic features -- just enough to post blog articles. In addition to blog posting, it supports the following:
- Favicons using Font Awesome
- Tags 

## Installation
After creating your Hugo site, download or Git Clone this repository and copy the directory to the "themes" folder.
