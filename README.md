Waffles is a minimal dark Hugo theme created for my CyBlog website. 
The colorway follows the cliché "hacking" computer terminal look — a black/grey background with green text. The theme is named after our Shih Tzu, Waffle, or "fifi" for short, and was inspired by the Risotto Hugo theme.

## Features

The current theme version only has basic features -- enough to create blog posts. In addition to blog posting, it supports the following:
- Plain HTML/CSS, no JavaScript and frameworks
- Favicons support using Font Awesome
- Tags (Taxonomy) for post categorization

## Installation 
After creating your Hugo site, download or Git Clone this repository and copy the directory to the site's `themes` directory using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/UncleSocks/waffles-hugo-theme-for-cyblog  themes/waffles
```

### Configuration
Then, configure the Hugo site to use the Waffles theme by adding `theme = 'waffles'` to the `hugo.toml` file or `theme: waffles` to the `hugo.yaml` file.

## Theme Modification
In addition to the listed features above, you can modify the theme's menu, site's title, description, and copyright on the `hugo.toml` or `hugo.yaml` file. A sample site is available in the `exampleSite` directory for reference.
