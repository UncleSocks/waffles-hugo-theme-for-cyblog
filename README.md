# Waffles: A Hugo Theme for CyBlog
Waffles is a minimal dark Hugo theme inspired by the Risotto theme, created for my CyBlog website. 
The colorway is modeled after the cliché "hacking" computer terminal — a black/grey background with green text. The theme is named after our Shih Tzu, Waffle, or "fifi" for short.

_Please note that this is the initial release and is still under development._

## Features

The current version of the theme only has basic features -- just enough to post blog articles. In addition to blog posting, it supports the following:
- Favicons using Font Awesome
- Tags 

## Installation
After creating your Hugo site, download or Git Clone this repository and copy the directory to the "themes" folder.
